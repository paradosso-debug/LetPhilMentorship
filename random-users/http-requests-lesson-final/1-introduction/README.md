# Introduction to HTTP Requests

Imagine ordering a pizza! üçï
- Browser = You
- Server = Pizza Shop

**Synchronous vs Asynchronous**
- Synchronous: Wait and can't do anything else.
- Asynchronous: Keep doing homework while waiting!

This module sets the stage for understanding how browsers talk to servers.
