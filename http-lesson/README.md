# HTTP Requests in JavaScript

This lesson covers how to make HTTP requests using 4 different approaches:

1. **XMLHttpRequest (XHR)** - Old school, callback-based
2. **Promises** - Modern way to handle asynchronous operations
3. **async/await** - Cleaner syntax built on top of Promises
4. **Axios** - A powerful HTTP library that simplifies requests

Each method fetches user data from: https://randomuser.me/api/
