# Axios

## ✅ What is it?

- A modern JavaScript **library** for making HTTP requests.
- Built on Promises but has a **simpler and more powerful API**.
- Automatically parses JSON, supports all methods (GET, POST, etc.).

## ⚙️ How it works:

1. Use `axios.get('url')` to make a request.
2. Handle the result using `.then()` or `await`.

## 🔍 Where to see it:

- Open `axios.html` in your browser.
- Click the button labeled **"Get User (Axios)"**.
- It will use Axios to fetch and show a random user.

## 🚫 Drawbacks:

- You need to include Axios separately via CDN or package manager.
- Slightly bigger than built-in `fetch()`.
