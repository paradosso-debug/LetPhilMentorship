## Creating Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

**Think of it like:** Writing a recipe once and reusing it every time you want to cook that dish.

### Why it works:
- You define a function using the `function` keyword followed by a name and parentheses.
- The code inside the curly braces `{}` runs when the function is called.

```js
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello!');
}

greet(); // Calling the function
```
Here, `greet()` runs the code inside the function. It prints 'Hello!' to the console.

**Why this is useful:** You avoid repeating the same code over and over again.
