# Parent Calling Child with Data

## 🧠 What This Teaches:
- Functions can be composed — one function can call others with data
- Shows how to manage structured data display

## 🔄 How This Relates to React:
- A React app is made of a **tree of components**:
  ```jsx
  function App() {
    return <UserCard name="Tania" />;
  }
  ```
- This exercise simulates how a **parent component passes props** to a child.

## 🔍 Real-Life Analogy:
- Like a manager (parent) assigning tasks to workers (children) based on their skills.
