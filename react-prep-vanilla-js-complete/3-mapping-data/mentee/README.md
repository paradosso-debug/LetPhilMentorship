# Mapping Through Data

## 🧠 What This Teaches:
- How to use `.forEach()` to loop through arrays and render UI

## 🔄 How This Relates to React:
- React developers often use `.map()` to render lists:
  ```jsx
  users.map(user => <UserCard {...user} />)
  ```
- This task prepares the mental model of looping through data to create multiple components.

## 🔍 Real-Life Analogy:
- Like mass-producing invitation cards by looping over a guest list and filling in each name.
