# Local State with Event Listeners

## 🧠 What This Teaches:
- How UI can respond to internal variable changes
- How to update the DOM when a value changes

## 🔄 How This Relates to React:
- In React, this is similar to using `useState()`:
  ```jsx
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  ```
- Clicking the button updates state and triggers a re-render.
- This JS example simulates that by manually changing a variable and updating the DOM.

## 🔍 Real-Life Analogy:
- Like keeping score at a game: each time someone scores, you update the scoreboard.
